# CELL DATA IN-DEPTH EDA

Here we are presented with single cell data. The data can be obtained here. Make sure you run the scripts in the following order, since scripts can rely on output produced by other scripts.

## Project Overview
- cells express different features that can be measured
- there is a known flow of information from DNA to RNA to proteins
- the assumption is obvious that measurments from DNA can be used to predict states of RNA and knwoledge about RNA can be used to predict states of proteins

## Challenges
- the datasets are quite big with the biggest dataset containing over 20 Billion entries
