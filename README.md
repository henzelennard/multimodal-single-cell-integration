# Multimodal Single Cell Integration
Here we are presented with single cell data. The data can be obtained here. Make sure you run the scripts in the following order, since scripts can rely on output produced by other scripts.
* data-transformations.ipynb
* feature-generation.ipynb
* eda.ipynb

## Transformation of data
The first thing we do is transform the datasets we have. We apply better compression and also transpose the data to obtain an columnoriented dataset.
